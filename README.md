# Vulnflow

Vulnflow is an open-source **web vulnerability scanning framework** designed for **authorized penetration testing and security research**.

It automates the process of **URL discovery, filtering active endpoints, eliminating redundant parameters**, and running **general vulnerability scans** on the resulting attack surface.  
Vulnflow is built to reduce noise, save time, and improve efficiency during reconnaissance and scanning phases.
